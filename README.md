## Premise

Helping users track their sleep. They can enter the amount of sleep they get each night and also list what their pre-sleep routine consisted of (meditation, melatonin, white-noise etc.). Data is then listed to display on the page to see how others are sleeping and what the average sleep for all users is (in addition to other data)

## User Stories

 - As a user, I want to add sleep data to my profile so that I can track
   my sleeping patterns.
 - As a user, I want to adjust my sleep data so I can maintain accurate
   sleep data.
  - As a user, I want to delete my sleep data to remove an entry as
   needed.
  - As a user, I want to identify my sleep aids and routine so that I can
   reference the circumstances where I get the best sleep.
